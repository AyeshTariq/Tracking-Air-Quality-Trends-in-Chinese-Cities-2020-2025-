Analyzing air pollution trends from 2020 to 2025 (pre-COVID & post-COVID) to understand how pollution levels vary across different cities and seasons.
Focusing on six major air pollutants:

PM2.5 is caused by vehicles, industries, burning of fuels, and dust storms)

PM10 (larger particles like dust, pollen, and ash)

Ozone (O3) (Not directly emitted but forms when pollutants like NO2 and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) react in sunlight)

Carbon Monoxide (CO) (power plants, biomass burning, and forest fires)

Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) (from industries)

Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) (from vehicles & factories)

All these parameters are in Micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³).
